<h1>Lost Love</h1>
<h2>by Frank Riccobono</h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed about the young man sitting across from me on the
train into New York today was his mustache. He was my age or younger, but had a
bushy 80s mustache that looked out of place on someone so young. He spent the
ride talking to a young woman, whom I assume was his girlfriend based on body
language, and looking generally content.</p>

<p>I didn't notice the older man sitting next to them at first. Eventually I
realized that he wore the same mustache though his hair had gone about half
gray. The hair that wasn't gray, though, was the same color as that of the
young man. The faces of the two men, though one young and the other wrinkled,
had a similar shape as well.</p>

<p>During the ride, the old man glanced over his shoulder at the couple several
times. He spent most of the ride twiddling his wedding ring and checking his
watch. He held a daily newspaper or magazine under his arm but never looked at
it.</p>

<p>In light of these sights, I have come to the only conclusion a logical person
such as myself could...today I met a time traveler on the PATH train wistful
for a lost love.</p>
