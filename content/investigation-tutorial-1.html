  <li>Search the crime scene for a likely surface to yield a usable set of prints. Smooth surfaces such as drinking glasses or doorknobs are ideal.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle fingerprinting dust onto the surface.</li>
  <li>Using a soft brush, clear away the excess dust revealing the telltale swirls and arcs of a fingerprint.</li>
  <li>Gently lay a piece of clear tape over the imprint, taking care not to smudge it.</li>
  <li>Contact your local biomedical research facility and ask to borrow their skin-graft 3D printer.</li>
  <li>Use the machine to construct a flesh glove with the prints on the appropriate fingers.</li>
  <li>Put the glove on your hand. They are now your fingerprints. You are the suspect.</li>
  <li>Thrill in the exhilaration of being on the run from the law.</li>
  <li>Feel secure in the knowledge that you will never be caught because you are the law.</li>
  <li> Spend a good few minutes getting into this state of mind.</li>
  <li> Use your nascent psychic link to track down the suspect. Where would John Doe go? You are now John Doe. Where would you go?</li>
  <li> When your paths inevitably cross, cast off the glove and resume your prior life. You have no more need of these fingerprints.</li>
  <li> Arrest the suspect and continue the investigation.</li>
</ol>
