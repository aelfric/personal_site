title: Zombie Love Song
description: In the Summer of 2009, near the beginning of the <em>Twilight</em> movie craze, I read an article predicting that Zombies would most likely be the next traditional horror monster to be romanticized.  Naturally, I wanted to be ahead of the trend.

<p class=MsoNormal><em>(GIRL screaming runs across stage pursued by zombies in a T
formation with the CROONER in the lead.  ZOMBIES make typical zombie groans as
they cross the stage, but when the GIRL has left the stage, the CROONER is
upset.  As the song goes on, the GIRL returns to the stage, still keeping her
distance from the ZOMBIES but seemingly considering the CROONER more seriously)</em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ZOMBIE CROONER: (spoken) No wait!  Please let me explain.(music
starts)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've been in love with you <br>
since I set my rotting eyes on you<br>
(I hope my eyes don't smell to bad)<br>
You're pretty &mdash; no you're beautiful<br>
&mdash; and smart, you know I like a girl with brains.</p>
<p>BACKUP ZOMBIES<br>
Maybe now more than before</p>
<p>ZOMBIE CROONER:<br>
But if you'll let me through the door<br>
I'll hold you forever more<br>
I'll show you how great zombie love can be!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am a Zombie.<br>
That much is clear.<br>
But I will always<br>
Hold you dear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You like chocolates<br>
I like brains<br>
There must be something<br>
We can arrange</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'll bring you chocolates every day<br>
I guess you can't bring me brains,<br>
but maybe when we're married<br>
You can let me eat your bridesmaids</p>
<p>BACKUP ZOMBIES<br>
He never cared for wedding cake.</p>
<p>ZOMBIE CROONER<br>
But If you'll let me in your life,<br>
If you'll agree to be my wife,<br>
I'll show you how long zombie love can last!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some say their love's immortal,<br>
And then they pass away,<br>
But I am immortal,<br>
'less someone kills me with a headshot</p>
<p><em>(SFX: BOOM!)</em><p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Loving a zombie<br>
You think it's sick<br>
I hope those feelings<br>
Will not stick</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My skin may be peeling off,<br>
My insides turned to mush,<br>
But I assure I am every inch<br>
The man I always was </p>
<p>BACKUP ZOMBIES:<br>
(Zombies are very well endowed)</p>
<p>ZOMBIE CROONER:<br>
It's not necrophilia, <br>
It's un-necrophila,<br>
and there's no social taboos against that</p>
<p>BACKUP ZOMBIES<br>
There's never been a zombie plague before.</p>
<p>ZOMBIE CROONER:<br>
And if you let me in your home<br>
If you let me call you my own<br>
I'll show you how strong zombie love can be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just say yes<br>
We'll never part<br>
You're the one to whom I<br>
give my heart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em>(Music stops abruptly as the CROONER reaches into his chest,
	rips out his heart, and offers it to the GIRL, who runs away screaming.)</em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CROONER: (spoken) Did I come on too strong?</p>
