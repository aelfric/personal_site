<p>Look at that, another pile of
cinders.<br>Every flame she spouts her progress hinders.<br>You might think I’m
being somewhat rash,<br>But everything I see’s been turned to ash.</p><p>[ELIZA
(a dragon), lets out a belch of fire]</p><p>(Spoken) Heavens, what a
blaze!</p><p>This is what the dragon population<br>Calls a mostly minor
conflagration.</p><p>See her taking to the skies,<br>Terror growing in our
eyes,<br>Wondering whose house she’s going to roast.<br>Is that thatching on
your roof?<br>That’s not very fireproof.<br>Soon enough this whole street will
be toast.</p><p>Feel the warmth upon the air<br>Catch a glimpse of scarlet
flare<br>I'd rather turn and run the other way.<br>Knight comes charging with a
sword,<br>Hoping for a big reward.</p><p>(Spoken) I tell you, that’s the worst
part of her day.</p><p>It’s fire and smoke that keep her in her place.<br>Not
her scaly hide and spiny face.</p><p>Why can't the dragons teach their children
not to burn?<br>This pyrotechnic damage<br>Is causing much concern.<br>If you
played with fire, sir<br>The way that the dragons do<br>Why, you might well be
chased with lances, too!</p><p>A dragon’s way of breathing absolutely terrifies
us.<br>Her incendiary nature leaves her sadly vilified thus.<br>A dragon at a
social function, we may never get<br>Oh, why can't the dragons learn
to…</p><p>Set a good example to creatures whose<br>features are painful to us
men?<br>A wailing banshee’s silent now and then.<br>There even are beasties who
chiefly will help when we say when.</p><p>(Spoken) Like those delightful
unicorns who protect the forest glen.</p><p>Why can't the dragons teach their
children not to burn?<br>An inflammatory subject<br>To which we should

restraint</p><p>(Spoken) Though socialites really don’t care what you do as
long as you use the right forks and keep your pinky talon raised.</p><p>If you
can hold those embers in, more folks would let you right through<br>Just show
you’re not a danger<br>And more people will invite you<br>But set a chap on
fire and your company he’ll spurn.</p><p>Why can't the dragons<br>Why can't the
dragons<br>Learn not to burn?</p>
