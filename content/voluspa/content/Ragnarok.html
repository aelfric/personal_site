<h3>Ragnarok</h3>

<p>The word Ragnarok used to be translated as the Twilight of the Gods.  This is due to an error in attributing the suffix "-rok" to the root "rokkr."  It actually comes from a very similar root that means judgment. <a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate"></p><p>RETURN</a></p>
