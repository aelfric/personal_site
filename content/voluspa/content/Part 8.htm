<p>42.<br>On a hill there sat,  and smote on his harp,<br>
<abbr title="The Sword's Watchman'">Eggther</abbr> the joyous,  the giant's warder;<br>
Above him the cock  in the bird-wood crowed,<br>
Fair and red  did <abbr title="'Watcher'">Fjalar</abbr> stand.

<p>43.<br>Then to the gods  crowed <abbr title="'Golden Crest'">Gollinkambi</abbr>,<br>
He wakes the heroes  in Othins hall;<br>
And beneath the earth  does another crow,<br>
The rust-red bird  at the bars of Hel.

<p>44.<br>Now <abbr title="A great wolf equated with Fenrir a child of Loki">Garm</abbr> howls loud  before <abbr title="The Gates of Hell">Gnipahellir</abbr>,<br>
The fetters will burst,  and the wolf run free;<br>
Much do I know,  and more can see<br>
Of the fate of the gods,  the mighty in fight.

<p>45.<br>Brothers shall fight  and fell each other,<br>
And <abbr title="The bond between sister's sons was extremely important in most Germanic societies">sisters sons</abbr>  shall kinship stain;<br>
Hard it is on earth,  with mighty whoredom;<br>
Axe-time, sword-time,  shields are sundered,<br>
Wind-time, wolf-time, ere the world falls;<br>
Nor ever shall men  each other spare.

<p>46.<br>Fast moves the sons  of <abbr title="ie. Mimir, the god of Wisdom">Mim</abbr>, and fate<br>
Is heard in the note  of the <abbr title="'The Shrieking Horn' given to Heimdall">Gjallarhorn</abbr>;<br>
Loud blows <abbr title= "The gods' warder.  At the time of Ragnarok, he would blow the horn to signal the appraoch of the giants' armies.">Heimdall</abbr>,  the horn is aloft,<br>
In fear quake all  who on Hel-roads are.

<p>47.<br>Yggdrasil shakes,  and shiver on high<br>
The ancient limbs,  and the giant is loose;<br>
To the head of Mim  does Othin give heed,<br>
But the kinsman of Surt  shall slay him soon.<br>
How fare the gods?  how fare the elves?<br>
All <abbr title="The Home of the Giants">Jotunheim</abbr> groans,  the gods are at council;<br>
Loud roar the dwarfs  by the doors of stone,<br>
The masters of the rocks;  would you know yet more?

<p>48.<br>Now <abbr title="A great wolf equated with Fenrir a child of Loki">Garm</abbr> howls loud  before <abbr title="The Gates of Hell">Gnipahellir</abbr>,<br>
The fetters will burst,  and the wolf run free;<br>
Much do I know,  and more can see<br>
Of the fate of the gods,  the mighty in fight.

<p>49.<br>From the east comes Hrym  with shield held high;<br>
In giant-wrath  does the <abbr title="Jormugandr.  Another child of Loki">serpent</abbr> writhe;<br>
Oer the waves he twists,  and the tawny eagle<br>
Gnaws corpses screaming;  <abbr title="Ship of Nails">Naglfar</abbr> is loose.

<p>50.<br>O'er the sea from the north  there sails a ship<br>
With the people of Hel,  at the helm stands Loki;<br>
After the wolf  do wild men follow,<br>
And with them the <abbr title="ie. Loki">brother  of Byleist</abbr> goes.

<p>51.<br>Surt fares from the south  with the <abbr title="Fire">scourge of branches</abbr>,<br>
The sun of the battle-gods  shone from his sword;<br>
The crags are sundered,  the giant-women sink,<br>
The dead throng Hel-way,  and heaven is cloven.

<p>52.<br>Now comes <abbr title="Frigg, already grieving the death of Baldr">Hlin</abbr>  yet another hurt,<br>
When Othin fares  to fight with the wolf,<br>
And <abbr title="Freyr, the god of peace and the harvest">Belis slayer</abbr>  seeks out Surt,<br>
For there must fall   the joy of Frigg.

<p>53.<br>Then comes <abbr title="'Father of Victory' <br /> A name for Othin">Sigfather's </abbr>mighty son,<br>
Vithar, to fight  with the foaming wolf;<br>
In the giant's son  does he thrust his sword<br>
Full to the heart:  his father is avenged.

<p>54.<br>Hither there comes  the <abbr title="Thor">son</abbr> of <abbr title="The goddess of the Earth">Hlothyn</abbr>,<br>
The bright snake gapes  to heaven above;<br>

<p>55.<br>Against the serpent  goes Othins son. 

<p>56.<br>In anger smites  the warder of earth,-<br>
Forth from their homes  must all men flee,-<br>
Nine paces fares  the son of <abbr title="ie. Hlothyn">Fjorgyn</abbr>,<br>
And, slain by the serpent,  fearless he sinks.

<p>57.<br>The sun turns black,  earth sinks in the sea,<br>
The hot stars down  from heaven are whirled;<br>
Fierce grows the steam  and the life-feeding flame,<br>
Till fire leaps high  about heaven itself.

<p>58.<br>Now <abbr title="A great wolf equated with Fenrir a child of Loki">Garm</abbr> howls loud  before <abbr title="The Gates of Hell">Gnipahellir</abbr>,<br>
The fetters will burst,  and the wolf run free;<br>
Much do I know,  and more can see<br>
Of the fate of the gods,  the mighty in fight.
