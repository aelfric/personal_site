<h3>The Story of Baldr's death</h3>

<p>Baldr's mother Frigg wanted to ensure that ner son would live forever.  She went out to all physical objects and made them promise never to harm her son.  Unfortunately, she forgot to speak to the mistletoe plant.  Loki, knowing this, decided to trick Hoth, Baldr's brother.  All the gods were throwing things at Baldr because he could not be harmed.  Loki gave Hoth a piece of mistletoe so that he could join in the fun.  Baldr died instantly.</p>
