<ol>
<li>Before you speak with the suspect, prepare detailed notes of what you know, what evidence you have, and what conclusions you can draw from the evidence and facts at hand.
<li>Calmly explain to the suspect the evidence that has led you to consider the individual a suspect,  including bluffs and conjectures as needed, to put soft pressure on the suspect.</li>
<li>Observe the suspectâ€™s behavior as you present the fact synopsis.</li>
<li>Offer the suspect the chance to explain why the crime took place before prompting them further.</li>
<li>Present an alternative set of circumstances that may have lead to the crime in order to shift the blame away from the suspect.</li>
<li>Alter the the circumstances until you find a set of circumstances to which the suspect is responsive.  Your goal is to try to gain their trust.</li>
<li>As you present these circumstances, marvel at the myriad decision points we face in a day and the infinite universes in which we live.</li>
<li>Explore the branching realities you have stumbled upon.</li>
<li>If you successfully navigate to a reality in which the crime did not happen, release the suspect.</li>
<li>If you find a reality in which the suspect admits their guilt, conclude the interrogation and have the suspect document their confession.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if you find yourself lost in the expansive multiverse you have discovered, use your notes to find your way back home.</li>
<li>Realize there are still an infinite number of worlds in which your notes are true.</li>
<li>Accept your new reality including any changes thereto you have inadvertently caused.</li>
