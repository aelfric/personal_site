title: Lamentations of a Unicorn Scorned
description: Sometimes all you need is a title to get started.  We were in a brainstorming meeting for our sketch comedy group, and someone wrote this phrase on the whiteboard just before leaving for another club meeting.  I knew right away I had to write it.  This is meant to have the feel of a liturgical chant.  Be warned, as you might guess from the title, it gets somewhat depressing.

<p>&#8479;&nbsp;Here begin the lamentation of a unicorn scorned.</p>
<p>&#8483;&nbsp;I dash my hooves upon the ground and ring my horn.<br />
My unicorn brethren have abandoned me.<br />
My fur is not white and thus I am forsaken.<br />
So long, now, have I wished to cavort with my fellow immortal stallions.<br />
Would that I could bleach my fur.
</p>
<p>&#8479;&nbsp;Betrayed by his kindred, the unicorn did try to join a bronco herd.
</p>
<p>&#8483;&nbsp;Even the horses contemn me.<br />
This appendage on my head betrays me.<br />
They know I am not of them.<br />
They fear and shun me.<br />
I try to saw off my horn,<br />
But as I am invulnerable, I cannot make a scratch.<br />
The rain is falling now, like my silvery tears.</p>
<p>
&#8479;&nbsp;Being cast out too by equine kind, the unicorn did try to befriend man.</p>
<p>&#8483;&nbsp;The human and his sons ignore me.<br />
They will not leave their work to notice me.<br />
They build and build.<br />
Each blow of their mallet is a dagger in my heart.<br />
Still this rain, it falls.</p>
<p>&#8479;&nbsp;Forty days and forty nights it rained.  The unicorn was near his death.</p>
<p>&#8483;&nbsp;I stand alone upon this hill.<br />
The flood waters rise around me.<br />
In the distance, I see the man and his sons.<br />
Their boat has saved them.<br />
Aboard the ship, the broncos neigh with happiness.<br />
The other beasts are saved<br />
And now, sweet death will find me.</p>
<p>&#8479;&nbsp;Here conclude the lamentations of a unicorn scorned.</p>
