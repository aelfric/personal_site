<h1>Stevens Monster Hunters</h1>

<p class='context'><%= @item[:description] %></p>
<p>What most people don't know is that many types of medieval weaponry existed
long before the medieval period. Homer tells one episode where Odysseus
fashioned a weapon by tying rope around a rock and attaching the other end of
that rope to a shortened spear shaft. Odysseus then went into battle flinging
the rock end of the weapon around wildly.</p>

<p>Despite his general heroism and skill in warfare, Odysseus did not manage to
deal much damage with his creation. It was not until much later that they
perfected the weapon by adding spikes and replacing the rope with a chain.
However, this Homeric version of the weapon shall forever be known as the Epic
Flail.</p>
