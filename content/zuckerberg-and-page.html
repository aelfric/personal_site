<p>P—It's Mister Zuckerberg!<br />
Z—Mmhmm<br />
P—It's Mister Zuckerberg!<br />
Z—Hello! <br />
As I live, why it's my old pal Mister Page.<br />
P—How long have you been here?<br />
Z—It’s been far too long, I fear.<br />
P—How did you get the Senate so enraged?
</p>


<p>Z--Oh Mister Page, Oh Mister Page<br />
I know just how to get out of this cage.<br />
Tell them all what laws to write,<br />
Which my lawyers then can fight.<br />
P--Positively, Mister Zuckerberg?<br />
Z--Absolutely, Mister Page!
</p>

<p>P—Oh Mister Zuckerberg.<br />
Z—Mmhmm<br />
P—Oh Mister Zuckerberg!<br />
Z—Hello!<br />
P—I hear that you have something you regret.<br />
With some lines of PHP,<br />
You have doomed our privacy,<br />
But you haven’t changed your business model yet.
</p>
<p>Z--Oh Mister Page, Oh Mister Page<br />
Our website’s made for folks of every age.<br />
They’ll make friends forevermore,<br />
And they’ll build a great treasure.<br />
P—What, their friendship, Mister Zuckerberg?<br />
Z—No, their data, Mister Page!
</p>
<p>P—Oh Mister Zuckerberg.<br />
Z—Mmhmm<br />
P—Oh Mister Zuckerberg!<br />
Z—Hello!<br />
P—Last night I saw some fake news in my feed.<br />
Though you’ve tweaked your algorithms,<br />
There are still some problems with ‘em,<br />
When you try to tell your users what to read.
</p>
<p>Z--Oh Mister Page, Oh Mister Page<br />
I hope that I can your fears assuage.<br />
We’ve done all that we can do,<br />
But *I* still see fake new too.<br />
P—What, on politics, Mister Zuckerberg?<br />
Z—No, that it’s our fault, Mister Page!</p>
