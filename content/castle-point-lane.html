<p>SCRIPT:</p>

<p>(GUI2 is onstage reading COPY OF REDSHIFT)</p>

<p>GUI1: (entering stage) That was the most boring class I’ve ever sat through.  I can’t believe they make us take all these HUMs.  It’s not like anyone really enjoys them or finds them useful.  Hey, what are you reading?</p>

<p>GUI2: Oh this?  It’s the latest Redshift<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>GUI1: Heh...Redshift?  As if there’s any creative people at Stevens.</p>

<p>GUI2:  You’d be surprised.  C’mon, I want to show you something.</p>

<p>(Music starts.  GUIs walk to one side of the stage while the ART/TECH GUI and the FRIEND get into position.)</p>

<p>GUI1: Do you hear that?</p>

<p>(Throughout the song, the characters act out the actions being described in the lyrics.  GUI2 ignores all of GUI1’s interjections.)</p>

<p>GUI2:
AT CASTLE POINT, THERE IS AN ART-TECH TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS</p>

<p>GUI1: Dude, why are you singing?</p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
OF ALL THE FRIENDS THAT SHE COULD BRIBE TO HELP HER OUT<br />
AND ALL THE ENGINEERS WHO PASS HER BY<br />
STOP TO LAUGH AND SHOUT.</p>

<p>GUI1: You realize this is kind of strange, right?</p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
THE ART-TECH SHRUGS AND KEEPS ON CLICKING WITH HER SLR<br />
SHE’S USED TO TAKING ALL THE ENGINEERS’ FLACK<br />
AND THE ART-TECH ONLY OWNS A MAC<br />
AND NOT A PC...<br />
HAPPILY</p>

<p>(GUI2 begins some light choreography with ART/TECH GUI and FRIEND during the refrain while ENGINEER GUI and PHYSICS PROFESSOR get into place on opposite side of stage.  ENGINEER GUI is seated notebook and pencil in hand, but not really writing it it.  He’s barely paying attention to PHYSICS PROFESSOR who is scribbling physics notes on the board.)</p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
CASTLE POINT IS MORE THAN MATH AND MORE THAN SCIENCE.</p>

<p>GUI1: (In the background) Now you’re dancing?!</p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
THERE SOME CREATIVITY STILL SHINES</p>

<p>(ART/TECH GUI and FRIEND continue dancing, but GUI2 does not dance during the verse)</p>

<p>AT CASTLE POINT THERE IS AN ENGINEER IN PHYSICS CLASS.<br />
AND IN HIS BACKPACK IS A SUITE FOR THE BASSOON.<br />
HE LIKES TO KEEP HIS INSTRUMENT IN TUNE<br />
GONNA PLAY IT SOON</p>

<p>(If possible, replace the trumpet solo with a bassoon solo either played by the ENGINEER GUI or pre-recorded so that the ENGINEER GUI can mime along)</p>

<p>GUI1: (At some point near the end of the solo) Wow...he’s pretty good.</p>

<p>(This time PHYSICS PROFESSOR and ENGINEER GUI join in the light choreography with GUI2, ART/TECH GUI and FRIEND.  If the actors are comfortable singing, they can join in on the refrain. GUI1 is still skeptical but enjoying it a little more.)</p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
CASTLE POINT IS MORE THAN MATH AND MORE THAN SCIENCE<br />
THERE SOME CREATIVITY STILL SHINES<br />
AND THRIVES, AND MEANWHILE BACK</p>

<p>(PHYSICS PROFESSOR, ENGINEER GUI, ART/TECH GUI, and FRIEND continue dancing in the background.  GUI1 and GUI2 come downstage.  BIZ-TECH GUI should be sitting on the floor opposite of where the ENGINEER GUI started, writing in the JOURNAL) </p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
BEHIND JACOBUS OVERLOOKING ALL THE TENNIS COURTS<br />
A BIZ-TECH SITS AND WRITES SOME POETRY IN VERSE<br />
HER PORTFOLIO IS QUITE DIVERSE<br />
NOTHING CRASS OR TERSE</p>

<p>(GUI1 peeks over BIZ-TECH GUI’s shoulder to read the poetry and seems to approve.  GUI1 actually seems like he’s paying attention during this verse.  Again, actors mime the actions described, but a bit more stylized)</p>

<p>GUI2:<br />
AT CASTLE POINT THE ART-TECH SNAPS ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH<br />
THE ENGINEER IS READYING ANOTHER REED<br />
FOR THEM CREATING FILLS A SORT OF NEED<br />
THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN</p>

<p>GUI1: (sung)<br />
VERY STRANGE

<p>(GUI1 finally joins the choreography and sings along)<br />
CASTLE POINT IS MORE THAN MATH AND MORE THAN SCIENCE.</p>

<p>(ENGINEERS from first scene re-enter and dance as well)</p>

<p>THERE SOME CREATIVITY STILL SHINES<br />
AND THRIVES, AND MEANWHILE BACK<br />
CASTLE POINT IS MORE THAN MATH AND MORE THAN SCIENCE.<br />
THERE SOME CREATIVITY STILL SHINES<br />
CASTLE POINT</p>

<p>(After the music stops, all exit except GUI1 and GUI2)</p>

<p>GUI1:  I guess you’re right.  There really are creative people on campus.</p>

<p>GUI2: You know how else you can tell that there are creative people on campus?</p>

<p>GUI1: How?</p>

<p>GUI2: We’re in an original sketch comedy show!</p>

<p>Exeunt.</p>
