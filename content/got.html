title: Westeros Coffee in a Cardboard Cup
description: Now, I'll be the first to admit that even my keen prop-master eyes did not notice the now-infamous coffee cup in halls of Winterfell last night. That said, those at the intersection of Game of Thrones and Musical Theater fans may appreciate this little ditty by way of Kander and Ebb

<p>The trouble with the North today it seems to me is coffee in a cardboard cup.</p>
<p>The trouble with the Westeros society is coffee in a cardboard
cup.</p>
<p>No one’s every cautious here or circumspect<br/>
Always making
plans here that their foes suspect.</p>
<p>No one wastes a minute speaking pleasantly like “Good, my lord”,
“Not Today!”, “Are you going to bend the knee”</p>
<p>The trouble with the North today is plain to see is everything is
hurry up.</p>
<p>It’s ending soon. No more show. Only two more episodes,<br/>
and
dragons! Iron thrones! Dire wolves! Bodies and bones! And coffee in a
cardboard cup.</p>
<p>The trouble with the faux mediaeval life we lead is coffee in a
cardboard *doo wa doo wa doo wa doo wa*</p>
<p>The trouble as the Citadel would all agree is coffee in a
cardboard *wa wa wa wa*</p>
<p>Tell me what could possibly be scarier, than a ruler riding
dragons that will carry her.<br/>
Seems to me a commoner would much
prefer a &quot;Afternoon, you look cold? Would you some fire and fur?</p>
<p>The trouble with the North today is plain to see is everything is
hurry up<br/>
There's fights at night, speedy trips, sudden twists,
and smirking lips<br/>
And coffee, I think we saw coffee, I know we
saw coffee, I'm sure we saw coffee, in a cardboard cup</p>
<p>The trouble with the North today beyond a doubt is coffee in a
cardboard cup&nbsp;<br/>
The trouble is the way they take a shorter
route like coffee in a cardboard cup<br/>
No one knows the meaning of
“be merciful” and goes on taking everything so personal<br/>
Seems
to me we wouldn't be such nervous wrecks with &quot;time to breathe,
time to think, lower budget for effects&quot;</p>
<p>The trouble with the North today is plain to see is everything is
hurry up<br/>
It's all become “wrap it up” without the time to
strike a cup of coffee (coffee, coffee, etc.)</p>
<p>Coffee in a cardboard cup!</p>
<p>Dark! Sad! Bleak! Gritty! Grim! Stark! Swift! Pity!<br/>
Yikes!<br/>
Oh,
I gotta tweet!<br/>
Hurry up!</p>
