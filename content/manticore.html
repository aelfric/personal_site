title: Here Comes The Manticore
description: This was inspired by an episode of one of my favorite podcasts (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://www.jointhepartypod.com/'>Join The Party</a>) after they did a D&D session set in an opera in which a manticore featured prominently.  This is a silly tribute to the tune of &ldquo;La donna è mobile&rdquo;.

<p>Here comes the manticore<br />
His distance closing<br />
Fierce and imposing<br />
Hear how he&#39;s roaring</p>

<p>Damage you can&#39;t ignore<br />
Dealt by his spikey tail -&nbsp;<br />
Your screams are no avail,<br />
&#39;Lest you need goring</p>

<p>Here comes the manticore<br />
His distance closing<br />
Fierce and impo…sing…<br />
Hear how he roars,&nbsp;<br />
Hear how he roars<br />
Hear…hear how he roars</p>

<p>His face is hideous,<br />
Claws like a lion&#39;s,<br />
There&#39;s no use tryin&#39;<br />
To run from disaster.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re feeling brave<br />
Wait for his wings to flap<br />
You&#39;ll fall into his trap<br />
You are not faster</p>

<p>Here comes the manticore<br />
His distance closing<br />
Fierce and impo…sing…<br />
Hear how he roars,&nbsp;<br />
Hear how he roars<br />
Hear… … …hear how he roars</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Alternate ending for fans of the show:</p>
<p>Just for the last cadenza, TR8c runs on stage and sings &ldquo;I'll… … …I'll get the door&rdquo;</p>
