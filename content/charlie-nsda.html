title: Charlie at the NSDA
description: At the suggestion of his coach, I wrote these alternate lyrics to The Kingston Trio’s “Charlie on the MTA” to celebrate her student's (i.e. Charlie) second time in finals of student congress at the 2018 National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) National Tournament held in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.

<p>Let me tell you the story <br />
Of a man named Charlie <br />
On a humid south Florida day <br />
He prepped each bill in the docket, <br />
Thanked his coach and teammates <br />
Went to speak at the NSDA</p>

<p>Chorus: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
Did he ever affirm, <br />
Yes, he’d speak to affirm<br />
And negate with the skills he’d learned<br />
(What a trooper)<br />
He may speak forever <br />
Goin’ session after session<br />
In the chamber that never adjourned.</p>
<p>Charlie straightened up his placard <br />
As the P.O. called for order <br />
And he stood to debate the first bill.<br />
Hours later, chamber never moved to <br />
Previous Question <br />
Charlie’s there debating still.</p>
<p>Chorus: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
Did he ever affirm, <br />
Yes, he’d speak to affirm<br />
And negate with the skills he’d learned<br />
(The poor Parli)<br />
He may speak forever <br />
Goin’ session after session<br />
In the chamber that never adjourned.</p>
<p>
Charlie's coach goes to wait <br />
Just outside the chamber<br />
Every day to show her support<br />
And during each brief recess <br />
She hands Charlie a snack<br />
At that Bonaventure Resort.</p>

<p>
(3-minute banjo solo followed by 1 minute mandatory questioning)
</p>

<p>
Now you citizens of Natick, <br />
Don't you think it's a triumph <br />
That your student got a finals replay?<br />
Watch the finals stream <br />
You know that we’ll be tryin’<br />
To cheer for Charlie at the NSDA.
</p>
<p>
Chorus: 
Where he’ll speak to affirm, <br />
Yes he'll speak to affirm<br />
And negate with the skills he’d learned<br />
He may speak forever <br />
Goin’ session after session <br />
In the chamber that never adjourned<br />
In the chamber that never adjourned<br />
In the chamber that never adjourned
</p>
