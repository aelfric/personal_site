<p>Ah, look at all the angry Romans.<br/>
Ah, look at all the angry Romans.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar <br />
Warned by a mystic whose counsel he glibly derides.<br />
"Fear for the Ides".<br />
Full of ambition, <br />
Plays to the crowd and feigns fainting when offered a crown.<br />
Makes Cassius frown.</p>

<p>All the angry Romans, where do they all come from?<br />
All the angry Romans, where do they all belong? </p>

<p>Most noble Brutus<br />
Worries his country will suffer in tyranny's grasp.<br />
Lets out a gasp.<br />
Cassius approaches.<br />
Tells him to speak to a circle of like-minded men.<br />
Plans are made then.</p>

<p>All the angry Romans, where do they all come from?<br />
All the angry Romans, where do they all belong?</p>

<p>Ah, look at all the angry Romans.<br />
Ah, look at all the angry Romans.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar<br />
Stabbed in the senate by people he thought were his friends.<br />
There his life ends.<br />
Cunning Mark Ant'ny<br />
Stirs up the Romans to riot and take traitors' lives,<br />
No one survives.</p>

<p>All the angry Romans, where do they all come from?<br />
All the angry Romans, where do they all belong?</p>
