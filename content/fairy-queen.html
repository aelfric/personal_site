  He puts the drop from a flower<br />
  In the eye of an Athenian. <br />
  “Let them find love,” He says,<br />
  Then hides like a chameleon. <br />
  Awaken with enchanted eyes,<br />
  Let lovers find paradise, <br />
  Or a strong infatuation <br />
  They can't deny
</p>
<p>
  Mishaps and consequences <br />
  Lady wakes and takes offenses <br />
  Extraordinarily vexed
</p>
<p>
  He's a Fairy King<br />
  Winter's chill and shivering <br />
  Darkest night with an icy cling<br />
  Guaranteed to warp your mind<br />
  Anytime
</p>
<p>
  Ill-met in the moonlit night<br />
  Glamorous in dancing lights<br />
  Wanna fly?
</p>
<p>
  To prolong confrontation <br />
  She chided and berated him<br />
  In retaliation, <br />
  He and Puck devised a strategem.<br />
  She met an ass from Athens,<br />
  Pursued him in her fashion <br />
  Once again under powerful magic<br />
  She can't divine
</p>
<p>
  Her court, in any case attended him (in any case) <br />
  For her king, she couldn't care less<br />
  Passionate and intense
</p>

<p>
  She's a Fairy Queen<br />
  Summer's heat and opaline<br />
  Bower soft and verdant green<br />
  Guaranteed to blow your mind <br />
  Anytime
</p>
<p>
  Drop of an herb, she snaps out of it<br />
  Wonders at the counterfeit <br />
  Then music and a song and dance<br />
  Mirthful at this happenstance <br />
  To flee and bless the mortals’ beds, beds<br />
  They're out to bless you!
</p>

<p>
  They're the Fairy Crown<br />
  Briar, heath, and thistledown<br />
  Midnight blue and tawny brown <br />
  Guaranteed to change your mind<br />
  Anytime
</p>

<p>
  Ill-met in the moonlit night<br />
  Glamorous in dancing lights<br />
  Wanna fly?
</p>
