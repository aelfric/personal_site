<h1>Stevens Monster Hunters</h1>
<h2>by Frank Riccobono</h2>
<p class='context'><%= @item[:description] %></p>
<p>Students, faculty, staff, and concerned parents, I'd like to thank you all
for coming to this emergency State of the Institute Address.</p>

 <p> We knew when we set out on our five-year plan to grow the university, that
 there would be some growing pains. We have tried to prepare as best we could,
 but I think you'd all agree that no one could have predicted the events that
 brought us together this evening.</p>

 <p> In case any of you are unaware of these recent events, let me walk you
 through our latest understanding of what happened. As you know, our current
 undergraduate class is the largest in school history. This past Friday
 evening, a vast majority of those students were engaged in an activity known
 as Dungeons and Dragons. In fact, we now believe that this was the largest
 simultaneous role playing game session in university history. At that point,
 creative energy on campus hit a critical mass, which caused many of the
 mythological creatures from the game to manifest in our reality.</p>

 <p> Now, this has not been all bad for the university. Tuesday we welcomed
 Lucien the centaur to the campus nursing staff. He has been instrumental in
 treating the various student injuries incurred over the last few days. We are
 also confident that the Performing Arts Department will benefit greatly from
 bringing on a satyr as its new advisor. Additionally, we feel the small party
 of gnomes that arrived this morning have much to offer the Mechanical
 Engineering Department.</p>

 <p> We cannot, however, deny the various negative impacts many of these
 creatures have had. The Burchard Building remains closed while we continue to
 negotiate with the goblin horde that has turned the building into its
 stronghold. Giant spiders have overrun Humphreys in clear violation of the no
 animals policy. We believe the sight of a beholder in the bowling alley has
 driven one student insane, but this student was attempting to double major in
 biomedical engineering and computer science, so it's possible the student was
 already that way before the beholder. And identity card replacement rates are
 at an all-time high thanks to the dragon who has taken to hoarding duck bills.
 We advise students to stay clear of the Babbio Atrium where the dragon has
 established his lair, and our deepest sympathies go out to the families of the
 graduate students the dragon has already eaten.</p>

 <p> We value your safety and have committed ourselves to doing everything in
 our power to end this siege on our school. Of course, since we've already
 spent all the surplus budget we have on the five-year plan, we must constrain
 our efforts to what we can afford. Effective immediately, we will be creating
 a Monster Hunter work-study position under the department of Residence Life.
 Volunteers will receive free housing and free battle armor. You will be
 trained in combat by our esteemed fencing and archery coaches. You will also
 be taught magic by several professors in the Math Department, who assure me
 that magic and mathematics are essentially the same thing. Students interested
 in applying for this position will find applications at the front of the
 stage.</p>

 <p>Thank you all for your time.</p>
