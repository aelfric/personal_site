<p>Boys and girls of every grade<br />
Wouldn&#39;t you like to do something great?<br />
Come with us and you&rsquo;ll speak well</p>

<p>Join the N-Y-C-F-L</p><p>
N-Y-C-F-L, N-Y-C-F-L<br />
Yellow buses at the crack of dawn</p><p>
N-Y-C-F-L, everybody here can tell<br />
Do some warm-ups so your vocal cords will sound so bright<br />
Start your speech, everyone do well.<br />
At the N-Y-C-F-L</p>

<p>I am the Dec that hasn&rsquo;t been timed<br />
Speaking this long is considered a crime.</p>

<p>I am the bingo-winning drama piece<br />
Listen to me and your tears won&rsquo;t cease</p><p>
N-Y-C-F-L, N-Y-C-F-L<br />
4N6! 4N6! 4N6! 4N6!</p><p>
In this school&rsquo;s hallowed halls<br />
Everyone shouts at the cleanest walls</p>

<p>In this school, don&rsquo;t we love it now?<br />
Everybody&rsquo;s waiting for the rounds to start.</p>

<p>Debate that never end, Congress kids rehash again<br />
Gavel&rsquo;s waiting now to pound, and how they&rsquo;ll</p>

<p>Speak! N-Y-C-F-L<br />
Ready not to show, but tell</p><p>
Hoping you break?</p><p>
Well, that&#39;s just fine<br />
Fist at ten, C at grace,</p>

<p>Make an animated face<br />
Breathe with the partner in your Duo team</p><p>
Everybody speak, everybody speak</p><p>
In the N-Y-C-F-L!</p>

<p>I am the judge that&rsquo;s never been trained.<br />
I&rsquo;m just here to be entertained.</p>

<p>I am the speech with an anecdote<br />
I&rsquo;m winning rounds with a sympathy vote</p><p>
I am the Prose that you&rsquo;ve heard before<br />
Seventeen times, soon fourteen more</p><p>
N-Y-C-F-L, N-Y-C-F-L<br />
4N6! 4N6! 4N6! 4N6!<br />
4N6! 4N6!</p>

<p>Nervous freshmen everywhere<br />
Read their scripts and try to prepare.</p><p>
Extemp kids try not to yell<br />
At the N-Y-C-F-L!</p><p>
In this school, don&rsquo;t we love it now?<br />
Everybody&rsquo;s waiting for the rounds to start.</p>

<p>Tournament staff might, snake each room in half<br />
And place you in the order<br />
Speaking first in every round<br />
N-Y-C-F-L, everybody speak</p><p>
Won&#39;t ya please make way for a very special guy?</p><p>
Our Tom Beck is King of the Judge remarks<br />
Everyone hail to the President now!</p><p>
N-Y-C-F-L, N-Y-C-F-L<br />
4N6! 4N6! 4N6! 4N6!</p><p>
In this school&rsquo;s hallowed halls<br />
Everyone shouts at the cleanest walls</p>

<p>La, la, la, (4N6! 4N6!)<br />
La-la-la, la, la (4N6! 4N6!)<br />
La-la-la, la, la, (4N6! 4N6!)<br />
La-la-la, la-la-la, hey!</p>
