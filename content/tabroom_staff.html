<p>It's nine AM on a Saturday<br />
The regular crowd rushes in.<br />
There's a wise man sitting next to me,<br />
And he's trying to balance a schem.<br />
He says, "Son, can you get me the host school rep?<br />
I'm not really sure where he is,<br />
But the rooms are all locked, and the judge lounge unstocked<br />
And he needs to help out with all this.</p>

<p>La la la, di da da<br />
La la, di da da da dum</p>

<p>Give us a schem, you're the tabroom staff<br />
Give us a schem today<br />
Well, we're all at this school for tournament<br />
And we want it to start right away.</p>

<p>Now John is a policy interper<br />
Who never had time for his coach<br />
And he stands front and center, says, "I'm double-entered,<br />
But please can you tell me my code."<br />
I say, "Kid, I believe you're mistaken here."<br />
As the smile ran away from his face<br />
"Well, we see that you're not on the roster now<br />
Are you sure that you're in the right place?"</p>

<p>Oh, la la la, di da da<br />
La la, di da da da dum</p>

<p>Now Paul by the door is a friend of mine<br />
Who gives us his changes on-time<br />
And he’s ready to judge if you give him a nudge<br />
And he’ll do any rounds we assign.<br />
And our biggest school still hasn’t shown their face<br />
And five smaller schools all had to drop<br />
And we’re twelve judges down, two or three in each round<br />
And there’s nobody else we can swap</p>

<p>Give us a schem, you're the tabroom staff<br />
Give us a schem today<br />
Well, we're all at this school for tournament<br />
And we want it to start right away.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty rough start to the tournament<br />
And the opening meeting’s delayed<br />
'Cause each change that we get, means we cannot start yet<br />
And we’ll be here awhile, I’m afraid.<br />
And the freshman are practicing tongue twisters<br />
As their team members warm up their cords.<br />
Yes, they're building a feeling of unity<br />
But all they’re thinking about are awards.</p>

<p>Oh, la la la, di da da<br />
La la, di da da da dum</p>

<p>Give us a schem, you're the tabroom staff<br />
Give us a schem today<br />
Well, we're all at this school for tournament<br />
And we want it to start right away.</p>
