<p>This offer is subject to notice without change. Though great civilizations flourish and fall, though their monuments crumble to dust, this offer shall stand constant for all ages. And if perchance, as time continues its steady march, some sentient beings should see, or otherwise perceive, this offer, they too shall know its unchanging and eternal nature. And only when the last eyes have closed, and all other senses possessed by all other beings have ceased to function, shall this offer, unaltered as it yet will be, thenceforth go unnoticed. This offer is not available in all metaphysical states. Other restrictions may apply.</p>
