<p>I gotta take a little time, a little time to write my ballot<br />
I better write between the lines, and on the back if they'll allow it</p>

<p>Now, my comments are sublime, I'm like an artist with his palette<br />
Through my words I'll make you shine, take my advice and don't you doubt it</p>

<p>All this round, I've been watching them speak<br />
Did not stop to write a single critique<br />
Must start now, got too much to say, to fill this empty page.</p>

<p>They want to know what speech is, my comments will show them<br />
They want to feel what speech is, I know I can show them</p>

<p>I thought I'd take a little time, a little time right after round three<br />
But I've got nowhere left to hide, it seems the tabroom finally found me</p>

<p>All this round, I've been watching them speak<br />
Did not stop to write a single critique<br />
Must start now, got too much to say, to fill this empty page.</p>

<p>They want to know what speech is, my comments will show them<br />
They want to feel what speech is, I know I can show them</p>

<p>Etc.</p>
