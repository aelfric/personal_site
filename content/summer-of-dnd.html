<p>I got my first real dice set<br />
Bought it at the comic store<br />
Rolled them &#39;til the edges dulled<br />
Was the summer of ninety-four.</p>

<p>Me and some kids from school<br />
Made a mage, a ranger, and bard<br />
Jim brought snacks, Jody played DM<br />
We had fun; it wasn&#39;t too hard.</p>

<p>Oh, when we drew those maps<br />
The story seemed to swell around us<br />
Oh and if I tell the truth,<br />
I always felt so safe and sure there.<br />
Those were the best days of my life</p>

<p>Ain&#39;t no shame in campaigning<br />
When you&#39;ve got a lich to fight<br />
Spent my evenings round that dim table<br />
And that&#39;s when I met you, yeah</p>

<p>Sittin&#39; on your basement couch<br />
You told me that we&#39;d play forever<br />
Oh, and when we shared our dreams<br />
I knew that it was now or never<br />
Those were the best days of my life</p>

<p>Oh, yeah<br />
Back in the summer of ninety-four, oh</p>

<p>Man, we were killin&#39; orcs, we were young and geeky<br />
We needed to unwind<br />
We thought magic would last forever, forever, oh</p>

<p>Yeah</p>

<p>And now our daughter&#39;s wondrin&#39;<br />
Askin&#39; if these plastic shapes have names<br />
You and I, when we see that old dice set<br />
We think we&#39;ll show her how to play that game.</p>

<p>Sittin&#39; on our basement couch<br />
We&#39;ll teach her she can dream forever<br />
Oh, and when she holds that die<br />
We know she&#39;ll roll for something clever<br />
These are the best days of my life</p>

<p>Oh, yeah<br />
Back in the summer of D&amp;D, oh<br />
It was the summer of D&amp;D, oh, yeah<br />
Me and my family play D&amp;D oh<br />
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of D&amp;D, yeah</p>
