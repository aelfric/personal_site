<p>This is all in your nightmare. You are on the front line.<br>
Gonna have to train yourself a little bit if you wanna live through
the night.<br>
Cuz it&rsquo;s a post-apocalyptic war zone.<br>
Everyone&rsquo;s got nine different guns.<br>
So practice hitting those targets.<br>
You&rsquo;ll appreciate it quite a lot.<br>
Da da da. Da da da. Da da da.</p>
