 ANNOUNCER (spoken)<br>
 Speaker ZY 123 will be answering the question: "Will midterm election
 results lead to an improvement in congressional approval rates?"<br>
<br>
 COACH (spoken)<br>
 After considering this important question, we can see the answer is clearly no<br>
 for three key reasons.<br>
<br>
 ANNOUNCER (spoken)<br>
 Congratulations! You have advanced to the final round!<br>
<br>
 COACH (spoken)<br>
 Haha! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!<br>

 And to control my pacing.<br>
<br>
 LOGAINNE<br>
 Alas<br>
 His pace is still to fast.<br>
<br>
 ALL<br>
 'Cause it's a very long, ten minutes<br>
 Hard to stay in time limits.<br>
 So, he'll have to keep on racing.<br>
<br>
 COACH (spoken)<br>
 Returning from last year's tragic setback, William Barfee!<br>
<br>
 WILLIAM (spoken)<br>
 It's pronounced Barfee; there's an accent aigu!<br>
<br>
 COACH (spoken)<br>
 Uh, I'm not sure who this girl is...<br>

 And write a critique<br>
 All all about the way you speak<br>
 We speak!<br>
<br>
 COACH<br>
 It's a marvelous life event<br>
 If you win the tournament<br>
 What your successes represent --<br>
 You're good at public speaking<br>
 I see a trophy held by me<br>
 Qualified for states as well<br>
 Oh the stories I could tell<br>
 But forensics<br>
 Is not for glory seeking.<br>
<br>
 OLIVE (spoken)<br>
 Hi, I'm Olive Ostrovsky<br>
 Do you know where I check in?<br>
<br>
 WILLIAM (spoken)<br>
 Shut up!<br>
<br>
 LEAF<br>
 At the 35th Tournament<br>
 We try to win the argument<br>
<br>
 TEAM<br>
 What to do with GMOs<br>
 Or whether to legalize pot<br>
 People think we're<br>
 Out of our league<br>
 But that is exactly where we're<br>
 Not<br>
<br>
 MARCY<br>
 The judge says go<br>
<br>
 LOGAINNE<br>
 We breathe<br>
<br>
 LEAF<br>
 We wait<br>
<br>
 TEAM<br>
 If we want to break<br>
 We enunciate<br>
<br>
 COACH (spoken)<br>
 To enunciate is to say or pronounce clearly. not to be confuse with diction,<br>
 which means word choice.<br>

 LOGAINNE<br>
 We talk until our voice is spent<br>
<br>
 GIRLS<br>
 And still our hands are shaking<br>
<br>
 WILLIAM<br>
 We are<br>
 The slightest bit bizarre<br>
<br>
 MARCY<br>
 But when the timer starts<br>
<br>
 LEAF<br>
 Be still our hearts<br>
<br>
 LOGAINNE<br>
 We shall all perform our parts<br>
 To concentrate<br>
 On breaking<br>
<br>
 ALL<br>
 We concentrate on breaking<br>
 At the 35th Annual Villiger Speech Tournament<br>
 We focus on our main event.<br>

 We're learning useful skills.<br>
