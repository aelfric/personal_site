title: Enough Is Enuf
description: This is the version of my junior year Originl Oratory speech mostly as performed at the 2005 National Forensics League national tournament in Philadelphia, PA.  It ended up being a bit too long for the 10 minute time limit so there were some late cuts and edits that never made their way into softcopy.

<h1>Enough Is Enuf</h1>
<h2>by Frank Riccobono</h2>
<p class='context'><%= @item[:description] %></p>
<p> “Wé cildra biddaþ þé, éalá láréow, þæt þú tæ'ce ús sprecan rihte, forþám
ungelæ'rede wé sindon and gewæmmodlíce wé sprecaþ...”</p>
<p> Okay, I see you
shaking your heads, but before you think that you’ve entered the Twilight Zone,
or that this is actually the NFL International Tournament, let me explain.  I
really was speaking English or rather an older form of English – aptly named
‘Old English.’  What I said was, “We children beg you, oh teacher, that you
should teach us to speak correctly, for we are ignorant and we speak
corruptly...” It’s a line from the <i>Colloquy of Ælfric</i> one of the oldest
English Grammar textbooks.</p>
<p> Imagine what that poor Ælfric would think
upon hearing how English is being spoken today.  He would be appalled because –
well, gewæmmodlíce wé sprecaþ.  After all, our President once said, “It's a
time of sorrow and sadness when we lose a loss of life.” And, don’t forget,
Raid “Kills Bugs – Dead” As if there was some other way to kill them.  Such
abuse of the language has led the Bald Eagle Journal to report: “[English]
continues to become worse and worse and seems headed back to where all
languages once came from, a barbaric gibberish that creates less and less
useful communication.” To some extent, this is true.  However, English is also
changing and evolving and improving.  Hey, if you don’t believe me?  You try
saying that opening a few times.  This process of linguistic evolution is known
as <i>glottagenesis</i>.  As the world changes, languages either adapt or die
(Think of Hittite or Etruscan).</p>
<p> Today’s world is clearly changing, and
we must help our language to evolve, because we, the future leaders, are the
custodians of the English Language.  In order for us to take on such a enormous
responsibility, we must first understand where our language has come from, that
way we can take it where it needs to go.  And so, if you’ll let me, I will
reveal just how much English pronunciation, vocabulary and even grammar have
changed in the language’s fifteen-hundred year history.  If you listen
carefully, you will come to know how we, as English speakers, can foster its
growth.</p>
<p> When we think about language, we usually think of it as being
immutable or set in stone.  However, English was not created by a council of
grammarians sitting in a room – ‘I before E except…’  No, English grew out of
the languages that preceded it, and it has changed much since it was first
spoken by the medieval Anglo-Saxons.  Granted, these changes have introduced a
few <i>xenites</i>, or inconsistencies, into the language.  Think about it – in
the past tense ‘sing’ is ‘sung,’ and ‘ring’ is ‘rung,’ but ‘bring’ is
‘brought.’  ‘Quarter’ rhymes with ‘water,’ but ‘later’ doesn’t.  And if you’ve
ever wondered why E-N-O-U-G-H is pronounced ‘enough’ there is actually a really
cool reason.  It has to do with the vocalization of leading Gs, the lenition of
ending Gs, the shift from tense vowels to l…Okay, you don’t care.  Take my word
for it; it’s great.</p>
<p> You see, at one time English was pronounced exactly
as it was written, which would mean that at a French restaurant you would say:
‘Yes, for an appetizer I’ll have the qwi-shey, a Fillett Mig-Non for an entryy
and bring me a glass of your finest merlot.’  In part, these changes are the
result of the GREAT VOWEL SHIFT, which transformed the vowels into what they
are today, as well as the constant search for linguistic shortcuts to ease
pronunciation.  If you need proof, you need only look to Shakespeare.  In his
play, <i>As You Like It</i>, he makes a pun with reasons and blackberries.  The
pun just isn’t funny unless you pronounce it as the bard intended.  “If Reasons
were as plentie as Blackberries, I would give no man a Reason upon compulsion.”
Get it, Reasons, Raisins, Blackberries?  Yeah, I guess it’s not that funny
however you pronounce it.</p>
<p> Adding to our phonetic dilemma is the fact
that a large portion of our vocabulary has been stolen from other languages
(Hence the qwi-shey and the merlott).  These words often come with their own
unique pronunciations.  This borrowing is referred to as linguistic
<i>emborging</i>.  Consider this sentence: ‘The sinister vampire bludgeoned the
robot with a bagel and assaulted the ugly troll with a cravat.’  Okay, it may
not be from Anne Rice’s latest novel, <i>The Mechanical Vampire</i>, but if
English had not <i>emborged</i> the words from eight other languages, if we
were ever to see such a bizarre scene we would be forced to say, ‘Hey, look
at…that.’ If we let English grow, just imagine what we will be able to say
tomorrow that we cannot say today.</p>
<p> So if changes in pronunciation and
vocabulary are commonplace, change in grammar is no less usual.  As it has
grown, English grammar has become less dependent on word endings—conjugations,
declensions and the like—and more dependent on word order—the standard
subject-verb-object format.  For example ‘The man ate a chicken for dinner’
makes perfect sense whereas ‘A chicken ate a man for dinner’ is just strange.
In the future the meaning of a sentence may be determined solely by word order,
and, as for our favorite alien, Master Yoda, well, ‘Understandable will he not
be.’</p>
<p> So, everything was evolving and progressing nicely until a man
named Johann Gutenberg developed the moveable-type printing press.  His
invention was wonderful because allowed the easy spread of knowledge, but it
did so by literally locking language into place.  English was standardized so
that everyone could read publications like the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The
	Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The Washington Post,</i> and the<i>
	National Enquirer –</i> Hey, enquiring minds want to know.  What I mean
is a spoken language can change easily without many people even noticing.
However, when the power of the pen controls a language, that language becomes
<i>petric</i> or more resistant to change.</p>
<p> But now in this age of mass
multimedia, we have new ideas which we wish to share.  We are creating new
technologies which we need to name.  We see images which we must put into
words.  And so, we can see many recent linguistic changes.  Just think, e-mail,
download, cursor, blog, website, cyberspace, air mile, road rage, road map,
bloviate, and mini-me all came into popular usage within our lifetimes.  In
addition, over 9,000 other words have been added in the past three decades
alone.  What words will be added and what will be lost in the next few decades?
We have the power to decide.</p>
<p> And as the English lexicon changes,
grammar must be allowed to evolve just like living organisms do.  You see,
there are far less people —I’m sorry—far <i>fewer</i> people in the world than
you think who speak with perfect English grammar.  Most people are careless in
their speech.  They introduce ‘mutations’ into the language, such as replacing
‘going to’ with ‘gonna,’ or replacing ‘Hello, how are you’ with ‘Yo, what up,’
which through ‘linguistic natural selection’ will become part of a new grammar
system or will become extinct.  Now, our growing use of slang phrases does seem
to prove that quote from the Bald Eagle Journal, you remember, the one about
English declining into Barbarism.  Oh no!  Everyone, quick take up your
pitchforks, torches, bagels, and cravats.  We’ll storm the Merriam-Webster
headquarters and assault those ugly trolls.</p>
<p> Wait before we go
bludgeoning anyone, listen.  According to the Linguistic Society of America,
“Standard English is just one dialect of English.” And, yes, it has its rules,
just like any other language, but, in linguistics, rules don’t define a
language, they simply describe it, and they are therefore every bit as fluid as
the language itself.</p>
<p> My comloquerians, that is, those of us united by a
common language, look to the future.  Be progressive speakers.  Use new
expressions and grammatical structures when they appeal to you.  Create new
words like <i>comloquerian</i> if it pleases you.  Yes, if you’ve been keeping
track, <i>comloquerian</i> is one of five words in my speech which do not
exist…yet.  English is constantly changing.  Let us do what we can to help that
change come to pass.  Let us help our language grow by creating new words, by
assigning new meanings to old ones, and maybe even by perfecting our
orthography (those confusing spelling rules) – that alone would be a mammoth—a
megasuprendelous—task.</p>
<p> And if you were wondering, according to linguist
Justin B. Rye, that little opening might sound something like this in the
future: “*ZA kiad w'-exùn ya tijuh, da ya-gAr'-eduketan zA da wa-tAgan lidla,
kaz 'ban iagnaran an wa-tAg kurrap...”</p>
<p> I conclude as I began, in Old
English: ‘Ic þancie eow.  Beoð ge gesunde.’  ‘I thank you and farewell,’ or as
we say in Modern English, ‘Yo, peace out.’</p>
