title: If I Can't Solve This
description: Sometimes, software development feels empowering, and sometimes you stare at the same line of code for for hours trying to figure out why it's not working.  This was written after one particularly frustrating debugging session.  To tune of "If I Can't Love Her" from Beauty and the Beast.

<p>
  And in this error state<br />
  This bug has sealed my fate<br />
  And each attempt I make still hinders progress<br />
  And in this office chair<br />
  Head banging, and despair<br />
  This bug is driving me to utter madness.
</p>

<p>
  Hopeless<br />
  As my mind strays<br />
  As my eyes glaze<br />
  Tracing executions<br />
  Helpless<br />
  Tired of thinking<br/>
  Barely blinking<br />
  Searching for solutions.
</p>

<p>
  No tests could detect this,<br />
  No devtools inspect this,<br />
  No pathway I see, if I can’t solve this<br />
  No forums could save me<br />
  No fixes they gave me<br />
  Showed how I could solve this and make my program run<br />
  If I can't solve this, I’m done
</p>

<p>
  So much time I’ve watched this screen<br />
  Wondering what it all can mean<br />
  Flustered and frustrated, I pressed onward
</p>

<p>
  No signs of exceptions<br />
  No
  <code
  >Future&lt;&gt;</code> rejections <br />
    No logs anywhere, to help me solve this<br />
    No resource avails me<br />
    No help has not failed me<br />
    Help for me to solve this, help that could set me free<br />
    But it's not to be<br />
    If I can't solve this<br />
    Let this code be done with me.
</p>
