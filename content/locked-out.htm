title: Locked Out
description: Inspired by true events and Arthurian legend - that is to say one year I had a bad habit of accidentally locking myself out of my dorm room.  Also my dorm at the time, Castle Point Appartments (CPA), had its entrance on the third floor with a bridge connecting it to the street.

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Okay,
am I forgetting anything? I’ve got pens, pencils, notebooks, paper, textbooks,
backpack, glasses, jacket, cell phone, wallet…I think that’s everything. (Walks
out the door, walks a few steps then turns back suddenly.) KEYS! (He runs back
to the door, but he’s too late. He sighs.) Locked out again. Whatever, I’ll
deal with that later. I have to get to class. (Keeps walking away from the
door)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(Outside,
LARRY runs into ARTY)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Hey
Arty, listen, I know you have class, but can you do me a huge favor and let me
into the room real quick? I forgot my keys this morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: I
don’t have my keys either. I was hoping you’d be able to let me in later. I can’t
worry about this right now though. I really have to get to class. (ARTY gets a
text message and reads it.) Oh, well it seems my class was cancelled. I guess
we can worry about this now. What should we do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Don’t
worry. We can just call campus police to let us in. (LARRY takes out his phone
and dials campus police.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: Hello
Campus Police, how can I help you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Hi,
my roommate and I locked ourselves out of our room. Do you think you could send
someone to let us back in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: Of
course, but first you must answer these questions four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY:
(confused) Okay…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: What is
your name?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Larry
Rizzo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: What
are the last four digits of your student ID?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: 5555.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: What is
your room number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: CPA 305.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: How
much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: What?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: Answer
the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Well,
if a woodchuck could chuck would, it would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck
could if a woodchuck could chuck wood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >CPG: I’m
sorry. That is incorrect. The correct answer is 4 cords. You are hereby and
henceforth banished from CPA. Have a good day. (CPG hangs up)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Okay,
so now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Well
the RAs go on duty soon. They have master keys. I guess we can wait ‘til they
let us in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: I say
we wait inside. It’s kind of cold out here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(LARRY and
ARTY walk forward)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >TROLL: Halt!
Who dares cross my bridge?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Is
that a troll?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >TROLL: I am
Og, the troll that guards the bridge to CPA from unwanted visitors. And you are
not permitted entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: How
come I’ve never noticed you before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >TROLL: Well,
people kept using the Stute racks to prop the door open, so Res Life decided
they needed a better way to keep the halls of Castle Point safe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Hey,
look over there. There’s some fat kids over there walking this way. Maybe you
could just let us go, and then you can eat them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >TROLL:
Forget it. The last time I listened to advice like that, a billy-goat
head-butted me in the balls. Besides, I’m not going to eat you. I’m just going
to cast you into the ravine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(The TROLL
throws ARTY and LARRY down off the bridge. They land safely in the trench under
CPA. There they see a stick )</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Hey
what do you make of this? (He picks up the stick)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Look
someone wrote something on that rock: (reading) “Whosoever pulleth this stick
from this rock shall be king of all CPA. Ur mom’s king of all CPA. That’s what
she said. Delta Tau Delta rules.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Larry,
do you realize what this means? (At this point LARRY has taken a sharpie out of
his pocket and seems to be writing something on the rock.) What are you doing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: I was
just going to draw a penis on it. (ARTY just stares) So what does it mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Larry,
this means that I am destined to rule over CPA. We have to get back into the
building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: But
how?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(TONY
BLAZINI appears dressed like a wizard and holding the Res Life Handbook)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY and
ARTY: Tony?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >TONY: Yes,
it is I Tony Blazini, the wizard of Residence Life. Congratulations, young
Arthur. I placed that stick there in the hope that you would find it and accept
your destiny. And to you, young Larry, for being Arty’s stalwart companion
through his many trials, I give you this (TONY hands LARRY the Res Life
Handbook.) It will aid both of you in your quest. Now, hurry there is no time
to spare. The back door by the Tennis Courts has been left open for you. Enter
CPA and reclaim your room and your throne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Wait,
don’t you have master keys? Can’t you just let us in yourself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >TONY: You
must do this on your own. Farewell and Godspeed. (TONY disappears)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Well
then…I guess we should go inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(ARTY and
LARRY walk for awhile, open the back door and are met by a DRAGON)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Um…hi
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON: I am
Blagroc the dragon prince of CPA. Prepare to die intruders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(LARRY starts
flipping through the handbook. ARTY tries to stall)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Oh…um
how nice…have you lived here long?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON:
Actually I’m pretty new here. They brought me in…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Let me
guess…because people kept propping the door open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON:
Exactly. Now, I will destroy you with my fiery breath!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: I
wouldn’t do that if I were you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON: Oh,
and why not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: It’ll
set off the fire alarms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON:
Oooh, good point. Very well then. I guess I’ll just have to eat you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: But I
have this (holds up stick).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON:
Excellent, it’ll make a good toothpick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: Wait.
I found it. I call upon section 18 of the Res Life contract, Health and Safety!
Pets, excluding fish in an aquarium, are not permitted!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >DRAGON:
NOOO! Bureaucracy, my only weakness! (The DRAGON Is vanquished)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >(ARTY and
LARRY walk up the stairs to their room.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: We
still have no way to get into the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY: Hey, I
unlocked the door when I was doing laundry last night. Did you ever lock it
again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >LARRY: No…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span >ARTY:
Awesome! (ARTY and LARRY open the door to their room which was never locked in
the first place and walk off stage.)</span></p>
