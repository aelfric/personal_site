title: The Code I Used to Write
description: Code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live, especially if that future maintainer is you.

<p>
I’ve stubbed a thousand methods<br />
I’ve scoped a hundred objects<br />
But not until this test run<br />
Has everything been green.</p>

<p>But fleeting as a stack trace<br />
This bug goes by unnoticed<br />
I open the debugger<br />
I look and I am face to face with…</p>

<p>The code I used to write<br />
Bad patterns left behind<br />
A junior dev<br />
Naivete supreme<br />
Mistakes I should have easily caught<br />
Have brought new problems</p>

<p>The code I used to write<br />
Cannot be removed<br />
Dependencies remain<br />
Impossible to prove<br />
They’re not used somewhere out of sight<br />
The code that I used to write</p>

<p>And all abstractions melt away<br />
New bugs appear, much swifter now</p>

<p>For bad decisions made<br />
Tech debt must be paid<br />
Refactor this pain<br />
To keep my call stack sane<br />
As elegant as it is simple</p>

<p>Once foolish, now I’m wise<br />
Verbose, now concise<br />
Give me a guide<br />
To learn to override<br />
This inexperienced oversight<br />
The code that I used to write</p>
