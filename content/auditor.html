<p>I've a duty like a CPA’s<br />
At the end of each round<br />
On behalf of the officials<br />
I must write each rank<br />
In the blank – safe and sound:<br />
I don't care if you're a typing whiz<br />
Software can get out of hand<br />
I’m meticulous upholding<br />
The integrity<br />
As you'll see, of the Grand</p>

<p>I'm doing math<br />
With no mistakes<br />
Checking each value<br />
For the students’ sakes</p>

<p>Yes, I'm the Auditor<br />
And I know score<br />
Rank of three<br />
And the speaker points?<br />
Ninety-four</p>
