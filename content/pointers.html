<h1>Pointers</h1>

<p>Beginner C programmers are often uneasy about the use of pointers.Who can
blame them, really? The first time you encounter them, they can be quite
confusing. After awhile your aversion to pointers does usually subside. At
first I thought that this was for the best, but then I realized that it just
means we're all really sadists. Do you realize how mean you're being to your
computer when you use pointers?</p>

<p>Imagine you're a signal sent by the CPU to access some data from a variable,
but this variable happens to be a pointer being de-referenced. So you travel,
fighting your way through address line after address line until finally
arriving at what you think is your final destination. You knock on the door
only to have a little uninteresting pointer come and and say, "I'm sorry,CPU,
but your data is in another memory location."</p>
